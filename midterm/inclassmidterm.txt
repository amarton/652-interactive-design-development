20.  Do you now understand the following truths about building things for the Internet:
--A central feature of learning to build things for the Internet is The Struggle. And The Struggle is real.
--The Struggle does not mean you are bad at building things for the Internet. In fact, it means you are doing everything right. To borrow a phrase often used by web developers, The Struggle is a feature, not a bug. Keep struggling.
--Building things for the Internet often mimics life: tedium and struggle and frustration, punctuated by moments of overwhelming joy when things go right.
--The solutions to problems that arise when building things for the Internet are not always obvious.
--A great way to solve your problems: transform your problems into questions you can Google.
--Another great way: try a bunch of things until something works.
--Another great way: Ask another human for help -- but only after you've done independent research and tried a bunch of things.
--Lastly, building things for the Internet is not rocket science.  Anyone can do it and, yes, that means you.

(Free hint: the only correct answer is yes).
